1. max has only one template typename which means there can only be one input type. The example has one double and one int. A fix could be to convert the integer to double:
max(double(i),d);   

2. An unamed namespace is a namespace without a name. It is only accessible from the file in which it was created and thereby it reduces the number of global parameters in the project.

3. mutable can be used to "repeal" const. If a function is const it can still change a variable that hs the keyword mutable. something something lambda

4. Lets say we have two types T and U:
class T
{
    T(U){ /*...*/}
    Operator U(){ /*...*/}
};

5.

class Sample
{
    int i_;
    double d_;
public:
    Sample(int i, double d) : i_{i}, d_{d} {}
    Sample(int i) : Sample(i,0.0) {}
    Sample(double d) : Sample(0,d)
